# 19 React Projects

Throughout the process of building these 19 React projects, I gained valuable experience in several key areas of React development:

- **useState Hook**: Mastered managing component state using the `useState` hook to efficiently trigger re-renders and update the UI based on state changes.
- **useEffect Hook**: Leveraged the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from APIs and dynamically render responses in the UI, handling side effects in functional components.
- **Custom Hooks**: Applied the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to create reusable custom hooks, such as `useFetch`, `useLocalStorage`, and `useOutsideClick`, to streamline code and improve maintainability.
- **React Icons**: Integrated the [React-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) library to seamlessly add icons to the UI, enhancing the app's user interface with minimal effort.
- **React Loader Spinner**: Incorporated prebuilt loaders using the [react-loader-spinner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-loader-spinner) library, providing a smooth loading experience while fetching or processing data.
- **React Router**: Implemented [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/) for efficient routing and navigation in single-page applications (SPA), ensuring a seamless user experience across different views.
- **Global State Management**: Integrated complex state management solutions like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for projects that required more advanced global state management, optimizing scalability and performance.
